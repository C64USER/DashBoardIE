DashBoardIE
===========

Minimalistic Dashboard that works in old browsers (Internet Explorer 8 and before).
This is a minimalistic Dashboard that uses both of my previous works.  The Histogram and the PieChart.  

This dashboard was inspired by NPashaP Simple Dashboard available at:

http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/96447623ef4d342ee09b

However, mine is more minimalistic since there are browsers that do not support d3.js.

DashboardIE have been design with a very primitive and easy to follow javascript code.  Notice that there a no 
higher-Order functions (i.e. map, filter, foreach) there are browsers (i.e. IE8) that does not support them.  
The javascript have been tested in IE8 and WinXP.  Further testing is needed in other browsers.

If your browser supports D3.js, I encourage you to use NPashaP's Simple Dashboard
